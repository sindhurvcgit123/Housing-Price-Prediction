# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to predict housing prices based on various features such as location factors, number of rooms, area, and other housing attributes. The goal is to understand the data, apply preprocessing techniques, and train a model that can make accurate predictions.

This project demonstrates the complete ML workflow:  
Data Analysis → Data Cleaning → Feature Engineering → Model Building → Evaluation.
